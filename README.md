Following Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl, I built a Twitter resembling app, with features like:
•User Authentication,
•Email Notifications for actions like account activation or password reset
•a Following/Followers System
•Microposts that can include photos
•a User Feed on the logged in user’s Profile Page that includes Microposts from the accounts that he follows, as well as information about followers/following status.
Also I have implemented a couple of security features like Secure Password Storage, Authentication and Authorization, CSRF tokens, HTTPS, SQL Injection prevention, Session Management, Email confirmation for Account Activation or Password reset, Strong Password Policies.
By building the Sample App, I have gained hands-on experience in applying concepts like: Version Control(particularly Git), MVC and REST Architecture, Database Management, Testing and Quality Assurance, Dynamic Views.
